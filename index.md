## Scope
Drones have transformed into versatile tools with applications across agriculture, environmental monitoring, delivery, and surveillance, revolutionizing operations through real-time data collection and efficient task execution in diverse industries. 
As technology continues to evolve, the integration of robots alongside drones further enhances their capabilities. 
Robots can collaborate with drones to perform complex tasks and navigate challenging terrains, increasing efficiency and expanding the scope of applications.

However, challenges impede their optimal performance. 
Limited energy capacity restricts operational time, especially in extended or remote missions. 
Moreover, the integration of robots introduces additional complexities in coordination, communication, and task distribution between heterogeneous agents.
Such challenges can be solved based on a broad spectrum of algorithms, ranging from traditional combinatorial optimization methods to modern machine learning techniques. 
Algorithms play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency and autonomy of drone and robot systems, enabling them to adapt to dynamic environments, optimize resource utilization, and make intelligent decisions in real-time.

For this Special Track, ASDRoNet 2024, we seek submission of high-quality papers addressing both theoretical and practical aspects of drone and robot research. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, route planning, task allocation, resource management, scheduling, and network design for integrated drone and robot fleets. 
Furthermore, submissions are encouraged to delve into algorithmic advancements, computational complexity analyses, and real-world case studies that demonstrate the synergy between drones and robots in various applications.
